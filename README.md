# Multiplex Dependency Structure of S&P500 Stocks

## Introduction
The aim of this work is to analyze dependencies and correlations between S&P500 stocks using a multiplex approach. To do so I considered different types of correlations (Pearson, Kendall and Spearman) between historical prices of stocks.

## Build the Network
For each of the three correlation considered, I evaluated correlation matrices between historical log-returns of stocks. Then I filtered these matrices using the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph algorithm (PMFG). A python version of this algorithm that I wrote for this project is included in the notebooks folder. 
These preprocessing activity yields 3 filtered, weighted, undirected networks that, cosidered together, form a 3-layer multiplex network. 

## Multiplex Analysis 
I considered a few multiplex metrics to analyze the multiplex stocks network: 
- Overlapping Degree, to check the global importance of nodes; 
- Multiplex Participation Coefficient (MPC), to analyze the distribution of the activity of a node among layers; 
- Multiplex Cartography; 
- Similarity between layers;
